# StudentAdminstration

This is a github repository containing my project for the Advanced Software Engineering course at Beuth Hochschule, Berlin.

The aim of this project is to create a software for the Student Administration office at university for managing student activities such as admissions and registrations for courses.

The software was written in C#.Net.

The entire documentation of my solutions for the different tasks of the project was given in the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/majidam20/StudentAdminstration/wiki) .
